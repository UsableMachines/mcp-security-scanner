üìù MCP PROMPT ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
   Analyzed 6 tools, found 18 prompt security risks

üîç MCP JSON CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS:
   Security Risks:        0
   Suspicious Packages:   1
   Bridge Packages:       0
   Remote Endpoints:      0

üìù SUMMARY:
JSON security analysis completed using MCP JSON configuration analysis. Overall security risk assessed as HIGH. Immediate security review and remediation required before production deployment.

üîß RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Pre-install and verify all MCP packages before deployment
   2. Use package version pinning to prevent supply chain attacks
