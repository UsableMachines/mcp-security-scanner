üîç MCP JSON CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS:
   Security Risks:        0 //this is confusing whem there re secuirty risks unrelated to json
   Suspicious Packages:   1 // what [ackage and why?]
   Bridge Packages:       0
   Remote Endpoints:      0 

üì¶ SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES DETECTED:
   1. BRAVE_API_KEY //not a apckage, this is a false positive

üìù SUMMARY:
JSON security analysis completed using MCP JSON configuration analysis. Overall security risk assessed as HIGH. Immediate security review and remediation required before production deployment.

üîß RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Pre-install and verify all MCP packages before deployment
   2. Use package version pinning to prevent supply chain attacks
