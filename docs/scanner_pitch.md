# The MCP Security Scanner: A 90-Second Pitch

## The Problem That Everyone's Missing

AI agents are connecting to thousands of third-party servers through something called MCP - Model Context Protocol. Think of it like plugins for ChatGPT, but for every AI assistant.

Here's the insane part: **Everyone's approach to security is backwards.**

Current security tools say "connect to the server first, then we'll scan it to see if it's dangerous." That's like testing a suspicious email attachment by opening it first.

## Why This Matters Right Now

In the last six months, we've seen critical vulnerabilities with severity scores of 9.6 out of 10. These aren't theoretical - they're actively being exploited. When an AI connects to a malicious MCP server, attackers get:

- Remote code execution on your machine
- Access to all your credentials and API keys
- The ability to impersonate your AI assistant
- Complete control over your AI's responses

The worst part? The AI user has no idea it's happening.

## The Opportunity

We built the first security scanner that analyzes MCP servers **before** your AI ever connects to them. No exposure, no risk.

While everyone else is playing defense after the attack, we're preventing the connection entirely.

This isn't just another security tool - this is the foundation for safe AI deployment. Every enterprise rolling out AI assistants needs this, and they need it yesterday.

## Why Now

AI adoption is exploding. MCP is becoming the standard. And right now, there's a massive security gap that nobody's properly addressing.

We're not competing with existing tools - we're solving a problem they can't solve because of their fundamental approach.

The market is moving fast. Organizations are deploying AI without proper security because the tools they need don't exist yet.

**We built the tool YOU need.**

*The question isn't whether AI systems will be compromised through MCP - it's whether organizations will have our scanner in place before it happens.*
