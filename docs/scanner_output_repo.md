üîç SECURITY ANALYSIS COMPLETE
=====================================

üìä SUMMARY:
   Analysis Mode: STATIC
   Overall Risk:  CRITICAL
   Duration:      73898ms
   Timestamp:     2025-09-22T17:06:50.777Z

üíª SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS:
   Code Vulnerabilities: 6

üîç CODE VULNERABILITIES FOUND:
   1. CREDENTIAL_EXPOSURE (CRITICAL)
      API key is directly exposed in headers without validation or encryption. The X-Subscription-Token header contains the raw Brave API key which could be logged, cached, or intercepted. This creates a direct credential exposure risk in production environments.
      Line: 15
      Code: 'X-Subscription-Token': config.braveApiKey
   2. COMMAND_INJECTION (HIGH)
      URL construction using user-controlled parameters without proper sanitization. The queryParams are directly appended to the URL, allowing potential injection of malicious query parameters that could bypass API restrictions or cause unexpected behavior.
      Line: 80
      Code: const urlWithParams = url.toString() + '?' + queryParams.toString();
   3. DATA_EXFILTRATION (HIGH)
      Error responses include full API response bodies and potentially sensitive information. Error messages containing API keys, internal URLs, or sensitive data could be exposed to clients through the error handling mechanism.
      Line: 88
      Code: errorMessage += `\n${stringify(responseBody, true)}`;
   4. NETWORK_ABUSE (MEDIUM)
      Missing rate limiting implementation allows potential DoS attacks. The commented out checkRateLimit() function indicates rate limiting was planned but not implemented, allowing unlimited API requests that could exhaust quotas or cause service disruption.
      Line: 43
      Code: // TODO (Sampson): Improve rate-limit logic to support self-throttling and n-keys
  // checkRateLimit();
   5. PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION (MEDIUM)
      Insufficient validation of goggles parameter allows arbitrary HTTPS URLs. While HTTPS is enforced, there's no whitelist validation, potentially allowing requests to internal services or unauthorized external APIs through the goggles parameter.
      Line: 67
      Code: for (const url of value.filter(isValidGoggleURL)) {
          queryParams.append(key, url);
        }
   6. AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS (MEDIUM)
      Configuration validation only checks for options existence, not API key validity. Invalid or missing API keys could lead to service failures or potential bypass scenarios if the API doesn't properly validate the token.
      Line: 9
      Code: if (!options) {
    console.error('Invalid configuration');
    process.exit(1);
  }

üõ°Ô∏è  MCP Primitives:
   Server Name:       @brave/brave-search-mcp-server
   Tools Analyzed:    1
   Prompt Risks:      1

‚ö†Ô∏è  MCP RISKS IDENTIFIED:
   1. CROSS ORIGIN VIOLATION (MEDIUM)
      Tool "unknown-tool" references other MCP servers or external services
      Tool: unknown-tool
      Evidence: mcpserver
      Confidence: NaN%

üìù MCP PROMPT ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
   MCP server "@brave/brave-search-mcp-server" with 1 tools has 1 prompt security risks: 1 medium. Primary concerns include tool descriptions with hidden instructions and potentially exploitable parameter schemas.

üìù SUMMARY:
STATIC security analysis completed using source code analysis. Identified 6 code-level security issues. Overall security risk assessed as CRITICAL. Immediate security review and remediation required before production deployment.

üîß RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Implement secure credential management using environment variables with validation and encryption at rest
   2. Add comprehensive input sanitization for all URL parameters, especially user-controlled query parameters
   3. Implement proper error handling that sanitizes sensitive information before returning to clients
   4. Add rate limiting with configurable thresholds and proper backoff mechanisms to prevent API abuse
   5. Create a whitelist validation system for goggles URLs to prevent unauthorized external requests
   6. Enhance configuration validation to verify API key format and test connectivity before service startup
   7. Implement request/response logging with sensitive data redaction for security monitoring
   8. Add parameter validation schemas for each endpoint to prevent injection attacks
   9. Implement circuit breaker patterns for external API calls to improve resilience
   10. Add security headers and CORS policies appropriate for MCP server deployment
